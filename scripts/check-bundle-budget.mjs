/**
 * Performance budget for what actually crosses the network.
 *
 * The release gate asks for budgets, and the app is aimed at phones that are
 * often on mobile data. Aggregate sizes are measured gzipped, because that is
 * what a user downloads; raw per-chunk size is also guarded so the production
 * entry cannot silently collapse back into one oversized JavaScript file.
 *
 * The budgets sit slightly above today's numbers. They are a ratchet against
 * drift, not a claim that the current size is good: 98 stylesheet layers is
 * still a lot, and CSS remains the part most likely to keep climbing. Lowering
 * a budget after a cleanup is the intended direction; raising one should need
 * a reason.
 *
 * Run after a build. `npm run check` builds last, so use `npm run budget:check`
 * on an existing dist, or build first.
